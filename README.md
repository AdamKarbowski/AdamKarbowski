## Hello my name is Adam! I'm from New York and I love buffalo chicken pizza. I hope to master my computer science skills while pursuing a career in electrical engineering. I am interested in motorsports, running, mountain biking, and programming. I am a student at FHHS and have taken AP Computer Science A class.
